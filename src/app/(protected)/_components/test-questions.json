      "question": "A 34-year-old man with a history of bicuspid aortic valve presents with 2 weeks of low-grade fevers, malaise, and new-onset fatigue. He reports recent dental work. On exam, he has a new systolic murmur and splinter hemorrhages under his fingernails. Blood cultures grow alpha-hemolytic, optochin-resistant, gram-positive cocci in chains. He is started on intravenous penicillin G. To improve the rate of bacterial eradication, the infectious disease team adds a second antibiotic that binds the 30S ribosomal subunit. Which of the following best explains the rationale for this combination therapy in this patient?",

        "C": "Correct. Gentamicin (an aminoglycoside) binds the 30S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis. When combined with penicillin, which disrupts the cell wall, this allows gentamicin to enter the bacteria more effectively, resulting in synergistic, accelerated bacterial killing—especially important in endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci.",
